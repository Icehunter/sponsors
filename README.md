Open-Source Suggestions For My GitHub Sponsors

My [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Icehunter) can suggest and vote for packages (dotnetcore, npm) or projects to be created and prioritized.

## Suggestions

Anything that I know is fair game for creation. This could be dotnetcore, net full framework, WPF. A new website using react. A new robust backend API.

Do you need me to write some tutorials?

The more sponsors I have the more time I can help with new and existing ideas.

## Making It Happen

üëç to vote! If you'd like to see progress on anything here please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/Icehunter) me.
